Induction Motor Simulation

Created based on [Induction motor simulation in Octave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gImSv1Ps5Fo) video from [NPTEL - Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru](https://www.youtube.com/@nptel-indianinstituteofsci8064)

1. For running the simulation move to this folder in octave and type `sim` in terminal
2. Modify model.m if you want to simulate a motor with different parameters
3. Modify v3ph.m file in case you want to use different input voltage signals
